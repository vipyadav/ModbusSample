According to WikiPedia
"Modbus is a data communications protocol originally published by Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Modbus has become a de facto standard communication protocol and is now a commonly available means of connecting industrial electronic devices." [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus)
